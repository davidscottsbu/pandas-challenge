# pandas-challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to analyze data relating to test scores for students in different schools.

What I can conclude from the data is tht the charter schools have higher test scores than the district schools.

I can also conclude that Large schools (2000-5000) have significantly lower test sckres than Medium (1000-2000) and Small (<1000) sized schools
